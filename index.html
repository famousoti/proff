                                                    <p>1.	As a professional teacher, I have impacted over the years on the education of children and adults at various levels of education. <br>

                                                        o	I have contributed significantly in the development of the College in general and the permanent site of the Federal College of Education (T), Umunze in particular. The development of the permanent site was initiated by my administration after lying fallow for fifteen (15) years. The entire infrastructure at the site took off within my tenure as the Chief Executive of the College: the lecture theatre, the library, the School of Business, the School of Science, and the Department of Home Economics. <br>
                                                        o	Under my tenure, all the College courses were successfully accredited in 1998 and in 2005. I equally introduced the School of Sciences in the College programme of studies. <br>
                                                        o	I was able to keep the College crisis-free for over six years, thus maintaining the academic calendar. The College also remained a cult-free zone and was acclaimed nationwide for its high academic standards. <br>
                                                        o	Ensuring quality education through staff development programmes and sponsoring staff to workshops/conferences. <br>
                                                        3.	As Chairman of the Science Teachers Association of Nigeria, Anambra State branch for seven years (2004–2010), I created great awareness of the benefits of quality science teaching in the state through series of seminars and workshops. The state branch won many prizes at the National Quiz Competitions during my tenure. <br>
                                                        4.	As a Study Centre Director, I have made open and distance learning popular in Anambra, Cross River, and Delta States through several advocacy visits. This is reflected in the increased student population of these study centres. <br>
